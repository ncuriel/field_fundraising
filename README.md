I created a webform on powerbase (a version of CiviCRM).

I made input boxes for: First Name, Last Name, Street Address, Zip Code, Phone, and Email.

I created a checkbox list titled "Leadership Interests" with 4 options "Come to a march / rally", "Help out with youth voter registration", "Talk to other folks about these issues", "Help out with a political campaign".

I created another checkbox list titled "Issue Interest" with 4 options "Housing rights", "Workers rights", "Restorative Justice", "Families and Comunities".

I created another checkbox list titled "Canvasser" with 4 options.

I created an input box for "About the Supporter".

There's an automatically created "Next" button at the end.

On the second page of the form, there is a contribution webform embedded in our webform that contains a contribution amount input box. 

When there is an amount present in the above box, two additional sections appear "Credit Card Information" and "Billing Name and Address".
